# ArcRift — RAG Pipeline

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline is the core mechanism that gives ArcRift its memory. It runs on every prompt you send to an AI platform.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Chunking (on Save Chat)

**Algorithm:** Sliding window — pure TypeScript function, zero API calls.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Window size | 300 words | Small enough for semantic coherence; large enough to capture full context |
| Overlap | 80 words | ~27% overlap — ensures facts at chunk boundaries appear in at least one full chunk |
| Min chunk size | 10 words | Filters degenerate chunks from very short conversations |

**Properties:**
- Zero data loss — every word appears in at least one chunk
- Deterministic — same input always produces the same chunks
- No external calls — runs entirely in the backend process
- Personal facts ("my dog is called Noob") are never discarded

### 2. Embedding (on Save Chat)

**Model:** `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama
- 768 dimensions
- CPU-only — no GPU required
- ~270 MB download (one-time)
- Cosine similarity space

**Implementation:** All chunks are embedded in parallel via `Promise.all` — 10 chunks = 10 concurrent HTTP calls to Ollama, not 10 sequential ones.

**Storage:** ChromaDB collection `ARCRIFT_chunks_v2` with cosine similarity metric. Before storing, all existing chunks for that session are deleted — this ensures a clean re-save if the conversation is updated.

### 3. Retrieval (on every prompt)

```
User types → keydown/click intercepted (debounced 300ms)
→ generateEmbedding(prompt) — 768-dim vector via Ollama
→ ChromaDB cosine query:
    n_results = max(topN × 4, 10)   // over-fetch for filtering
    where = { sessionId }            // scope to active session
→ Score conversion: score = 1 − cosine_distance  // range [0, 1]
→ Threshold filter: score >= 0.30
→ Deduplication: best score per chunkIndex
→ Sort by score descending
→ Slice to topN (default: 3)
```

### 4. Sanitisation (on every retrieval — v1.5.3)

Before the chunks are injected into the prompt:

1. `sanitizeChunks()` scans each chunk for 10 known injection patterns — matching content replaced with `[Content redacted]`
2. `wrapInContextBlock()` wraps the sanitised chunks in a token-efficient text header.

Output format:
```text
=== ArcRift RETRIEVED CONTEXT ===
[1] (Relevance: 87%)
We decided to use JWT with 15-minute access tokens...

[2] (Relevance: 64%)
The refresh token bug was caused by a missing httpOnly flag...
```

### 5. Injection

The context block is prepended to the user's prompt using the Selection API and an `InputEvent` with `inputType: "insertText"`. This triggers the platform's React/Angular state update so the text appears in the input and is included when the user sends.

## Hybrid Search (v1.5.3)

ArcRift now uses a **Hybrid Retrieval** strategy that combines the best of both worlds:

1.  **Vector Retrieval (Semantic)**: Uses embeddings to find text that *feels* like the query. Great for "how to do X" or broad topics.
2.  **Graph Retrieval (Structured)**: Extracts entities from the query and finds specific facts (Triples) linked to them. Great for "what is the API key?" or "who decided to use Vite?".

### How it works:
- **Step 1**: The query is sent to the LLM (Ollama) to extract key entities.
- **Step 2**: The Knowledge Graph is queried for all triples involving those entities.
- **Step 3**: The vector database is queried for semantic chunks.
- **Step 4**: Results are merged. The AI receives both `STRUCTURED FACTS` and `CONTEXT CHUNKS`.

## Scoring

ArcRift uses **cosine similarity** (not L2/Euclidean distance):

```
score = 1 - cosine_distance
```

| Score range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0.7 – 1.0 | Very high relevance — nearly identical topic |
| 0.5 – 0.7 | High relevance — clearly related |
| 0.3 – 0.5 | Moderate relevance — loosely related |
| < 0.3 | Below threshold — excluded |

The threshold of 0.30 is conservative — it errs toward including loosely-related context rather than excluding potentially relevant information.

## Tuning Parameters

All tunable via `backend/.env` or code changes:

| Parameter | Location | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `topN` | `GET /api/rag/retrieve` query param | 3 | Number of chunks returned |
| Similarity threshold | `chroma.ts: SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | 0.30 | Minimum score to include a chunk |
| Window size | `chunker.ts: WINDOW_WORDS` | 300 | Words per chunk |
| Overlap | `chunker.ts: OVERLAP_WORDS` | 80 | Word overlap between chunks |
| Embedding model | `embeddings.ts: EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` | Ollama model for embeddings |

---

## ChromaDB Details

**Collection:** `ARCRIFT_chunks_v2`

**Distance metric:** Cosine (configured at collection creation via `"hnsw:space": "cosine"`)

> Note: ChromaDB returns `distances` not `similarities`. ArcRift converts: `score = 1 - distance`. With cosine, distance is in [0, 1] so score is also in [0, 1].

**Why cosine over L2?**
L2 (Euclidean) distance on `nomic-embed-text` 768-dim vectors produces values in the range 200–450. The formula `exp(-L2_distance)` gives values ≈ 0 for all chunks, making threshold filtering impossible. Cosine distance measures the angle between vectors — scale-invariant and appropriate for text similarity.

## Integration Test

`backend/tests/integration/pipeline.integration.test.ts` validates the complete pipeline against a real ChromaDB instance:

**Fixture text:**
```
"We decided to use JWT with 15-minute access tokens.
The refresh token bug was caused by a missing httpOnly flag on the cookie."
```

**Assertions:**
- Query: "JWT refresh token security issue" → score > 0.4, content contains jwt/token/refresh
- Query: "pandas dataframe pivot table" → score below threshold (< 0.30)
- Chunk count > 0 after embedding
- Query: "cookie security XSS" → finds the httpOnly fix

Runs on every PR via GitHub Actions (ChromaDB as a service container, Ollama with nomic-embed-text).
