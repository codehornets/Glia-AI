## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-13 — Documentation & Alignment

### Versioning & Alignment
- **Unified Versioning** — Synchronized version `1.5.0` across all modules: root setup, backend, dashboard, extension package, and manifest.
- **Architectural Cleanup** — Removed legacy `GLIA_SECRET` requirement and updated all docstrings to reflect the current state of the platform.

### Documentation Overhaul
- **Standardized Context Format** — Updated all documentation to reflect the move from XML delimiters to the Lean Text Header (`=== GLIA RETRIEVED CONTEXT ===`).
- **Npx-First Installation** — Refactored all "Getting Started" guides to prioritize `npx glia-ai-setup` over manual cloning.
- **New ROADMAP.md** — Introduced a formal project roadmap for future milestones.
- **New TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — Created a comprehensive guide for common installation and runtime issues.
- **Architecture Sync** — Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `RAG_PIPELINE.md` with accurate diagrams and thresholding logic.

## [1.4.7] — 2026-05-12 — Strict Identity & Precision RAG

### Identity & Anti-Hijacking
- **Strict Identity Architecture** — Sessions are now permanently anchored to platform-specific Chat URLs (`externalChatId`). 
- **SPA-Aware Navigation** — Added URL watchers to the Extension (Content Script & Popup) that detect "New Chat" clicks in Single Page Apps (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) without needing a page reload.
- **Identity Verification** — The backend now validates incoming Save requests against the URL; stale Session IDs from the extension are automatically ignored to prevent project overwrites.
- **Popup UX** — The Project Name field now remains empty for new chats, ensuring a "clean slate" workflow.

### RAG Precision & Token Efficiency
- **Hybrid Retrieval** — Implemented keyword boosting for search queries and corrected L2 distance scoring to prioritize exact conceptual matches.
- **Lean Context Injection** — Replaced heavy XML tags with a professional, token-efficient text header (`=== GLIA RETRIEVED CONTEXT ===`).
- **Context Suppression** — Glia now automatically suppresses the context block if no relevant memories are found, saving tokens.

### Stability & Infrastructure
- **Resilient Database** — Implemented a robust SQLite migration for the `externalChatId` column and added `busy_timeout` to handle simultaneous dashboard polling.
- **Graph "Silent Sync"** — The Knowledge Graph now persists node coordinates and topology. The simulation only re-heats if the data structure changes, eliminating the "2-second pop" reset loop.
- **Console Cleanup** — User-facing errors (like duplicate project names) are now handled quietly in the background script to prevent "Red Error" badges in Chrome.

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests** — Updated the full backend suite to align with the new Lean Header format.
- **Bug Fixes** — Resolved `ReferenceError: smartKey` and TypeScript indexing issues in the popup.

## [1.4.6] — 2026-05-11 — The Glia-AI Rebrand

### Rebranding & Identity
- **Project Rebrand** — Transitioned the project identity from **Synq** to **Glia-AI**.
- **CLI Refresh** — Updated the one-command installer to `npx glia-ai-setup`.
- **Infrastructure Update** — Renamed all environment variables (`GLIA_SECRET`, `GLIA_STORAGE_MODE`), Docker containers, and internal storage keys.
- **Documentation Audit** — Comprehensive update of all guides, architecture diagrams, and repository metadata.
- **Extension Stability** — Fixed a crash in the popup when opened on restricted browser pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`).

---

## [1.4.5] — 2026-05-11 — Frictionless Setup & UI Refinement

### Installation & UX
- **One-Command Setup** — Introduced the automated repository cloning and installation script.
- **Automated Extension Loading** — The installer now automatically opens the extension folder and the Chrome extensions page.
- **Smart URL Mapping** — Enhanced session persistence across varied platform URL formats (e.g. shared chats).

### Dashboard & UI
- **Unified Header** — Consolidated the dashboard top bar, moving Load Extension and Fact/Chat tabs into a unified, clean layout.
- **Improved Alignment** — Fixed multiple layout regressions in the history list and chat bubbles.

### Backend & MCP
- **MCP Resilience** — Updated the Model Context Protocol server for parity.
- **Logging** — Standardized backend logs for improved debugging.

---

## [1.4.4] — 2026-05-10 — Architectural Hardening

### Retrieval & Process
- **RAG Benchmarking** — Introduced a quantitative harness to measure retrieval accuracy.
- **Context Budgeting** — Character-based context window management.
- **Memory Decay** — Time-based relevance scoring for aging conversations.
- **Data Portability** — Session export and import functionality.
- **Bug Fixes** — Resolved UI deadlocks caused by missing polling routes and ghost jobs remaining in the queue after a backend restart.
- **Test Coverage** — Expanded unit tests for DOM resolvers and extraction logic.


---

## [1.4.3] — 2026-05-09 — Hybrid Search & MCP Evolution

### Retrieval & Intelligence
- **Hybrid Search (Vector + Graph)** — Both the Dashboard and MCP server now perform Hybrid Retrieval. The system extracts entities from user prompts and queries the Knowledge Graph for structured facts, combining them with semantic vector chunks.
- **Global Hybrid Search** — `search_memory` now performs cross-project graph scans, improving discovery across multiple repositories.
- **Smart Project Detection** — Added `identify_active_project` MCP tool to automatically match a terminal's CWD to a Glia project ID.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Improvements
- **Dashboard Visibility** — Manual saves from MCP-compatible tools (Claude Code, Cursor) are now saved to the `full_chats` table and appear in the Dashboard history.
- **MCP Resources** — Exposed the entire Knowledge Graph as a browsable MCP Resource (`glia://projects/{id}/graph`).
- **LLM Robustness** — Implemented try/catch fallbacks for AI extraction. If Ollama/Groq is unavailable, tools fallback gracefully to vector-only mode.
- **Config Generator** — Added `npm run mcp:config` to automatically generate absolute path configurations for AI tools.

### CI/CD & Maintenance
- **MCP Integration Tests** — Added automated tool verification to GitHub Actions, running on every PR in the SQLite-native environment.
- **Stability Fixes** — Resolved critical compilation errors and test regressions in the `isValidObjectId` validator.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-08 — SQLite Native (Zero-Docker) Migration

### Storage Architecture
- **Unified Storage Interface** — Introduced `ISessionStore`, `IGraphStore`, and `IVectorStore` interfaces.
- **SQLite Support** — Implemented `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` backends, allowing Glia to run without Docker (MongoDB, Neo4j, ChromaDB).
- **Dynamic Storage Factory** — Added `GLIA_STORAGE_MODE` (docker/sqlite) to `.env` to toggle between legacy Docker and new local storage.

### Onboarding & Deployment
- **Zero-Docker Fallback** — `install.bat` and `install.sh` now automatically detect if Docker is missing/not running and default to SQLite mode.
- **Resource Efficiency** — SQLite mode reduces RAM requirement to 2GB and disk requirement to 5GB.
- **Version Alignment** — Synchronized version `1.4.2` across all modules: backend, dashboard, extension manifest, and MCP server.

### Maintenance & Fixes
- **Unified ID Validation** — Updated `isValidObjectId` to support both MongoDB ObjectIds and standard UUIDs for SQLite compatibility.
- **Jobs Worker** — Migrated background extraction worker to the unified storage layer.
- **MCP Server** — Full support for SQLite mode added to the Model Context Protocol server.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-05 — Expanding Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

- **New: DeepSeek (chat.deepseek.com)** — Full support. Leverages DeepSeek's stable `#chat-input` ID and product-specific `.ds-markdown` classes.
- All platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) now share the same multi-strategy resolver architecture.

### Automated Maintenance

- **Expanded Selector Monitoring** — `scripts/check-selectors.js` and the weekly GitHub Action now monitor all 4 platforms.
- **Fail-fast CI** — Selector staleness check updated to alert on DeepSeek regressions.

### Version Alignment

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-03 — Security, MCP & Production Hardening

### Security

- **Prompt injection defence** — `backend/src/middleware/sanitize.ts` scans every retrieved RAG chunk for 10 known injection patterns before it reaches any AI. Matching content is replaced with `[Content redacted: potential prompt injection pattern detected]`
- **XML context delimiters** — all injected context is wrapped in `<glia_retrieved_context>` XML tags. LLMs treat XML-tagged content as structured data rather than executable instructions
- **SECURITY.md** — expanded with prompt injection threat model and Groq privacy disclosure

### MCP Server — Universal Memory Layer

- New: `backend/src/mcp/server.ts` — standalone stdio MCP server compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop
- Five tools: `recall_context`, `store_memory`, `search_memory`, `list_projects`, `get_project_summary`
- All tools use the same MongoDB, ChromaDB, and Neo4j databases as the Chrome extension
- New: `MCP_SETUP.md` — copy-paste setup guide for all supported AI tools

### Resilient Selectors

- New: `extension/src/platform/resolver.ts` — multi-strategy DOM selector resolver
- Each platform now has 4–7 ordered fallback strategies: testid → aria-label → role → placeholder → generic contenteditable
- `MutationObserver` in `watchForInput()` auto-reconnects when the input is not yet in the DOM (SPA navigation)
- Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini platform files updated to use `INPUT_SELECTOR_STRATEGIES` from the resolver

### Smart Ollama / Groq Auto-Detect

- `extractor.ts` — probes Ollama at startup. Uses `llama3.1:8b` locally if available; falls back to Groq with an explicit privacy warning if not
- `GROQ_API_KEY` removed from mandatory env validation — now strictly optional
- New env vars: `GRAPH_BACKEND` (force `ollama` or `groq`), `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default: `llama3.1:8b`)

### Production Dashboard

- `backend/src/index.ts` — `sirv` middleware serves `dashboard/dist/` as static files on port 3001
- No separate Vite dev server needed. Dashboard URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- Dashboard build reduced from ~5 MB to ~319 KB (gzip: 105 KB)
- CORS allowlist updated to include `localhost:3001`

### Lite Mode

- `docker-compose.yml` — added `full` and `lite` profiles. Neo4j tagged as `full` only
- New: `docker-compose.lite.yml` — standalone file with only MongoDB + ChromaDB

### Installers & Launchers

- New: `install.sh` — one-command first-time setup for macOS/Linux (~3 min)
- New: `install.bat` — one-command first-time setup for Windows
- Updated: `start.bat` — RAM detection (WMIC), `llama3.1:8b` model check, dashboard build step, plain ASCII output (no box-drawing characters)
- Updated: `start.sh` — RAM detection, Docker profiles, builds production dashboard instead of starting Vite dev server, adds MCP reference

### CI/CD & Maintenance

- New: `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` — full RAG pipeline integration test on every PR
- New: `.github/workflows/selector-check.yml` — weekly headless check for selector staleness; auto-creates GitHub issues
- New: `.github/workflows/release.yml` — auto-creates GitHub Release with extension zip on version tags
- New: `backend/tests/pipeline.integration.test.ts` — seeds a fixture and asserts end-to-end retrieval
- New: `ROADMAP.md` — versioned milestones and planned features

### TypeScript

- `backend/tsconfig.json` — `include: ["src/**/*"]` explicit, `tests/` excluded from rootDir, `resolveJsonModule: true` added. Compilation: 0 errors.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-03 — Startup Robustness

- Forced Docker Compose project name to `glia` — prevents errors when the repository folder has dots or version numbers in the name
- Removed Unicode box-drawing characters from `start.bat` that caused rendering errors in Windows CMD

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-26 — Zero-Loss RAG + Auto-Connect

### RAG Pipeline

Replaced the Groq topic splitter with a pure sliding window chunker:

| | Groq Topic Splitter | Sliding Window Chunker |
|---|---|---|
| Personal facts | Deleted as "filler" | Preserved verbatim |
| Short messages | Rejected | Always included |
| API call on save | Yes | None |
| Data loss | Significant | Zero |

### Auto-Connect

Replaced manual Connect button with automatic interceptor attachment on init(). Simple Pause/Resume toggle replaces the connect state machine.

### Knowledge Graph

- Entity types: 12 → 22 (added: Person, Pet, Goal, Problem, Preference, Habit, Tool, Pattern, Location, Organization)
- Relation types: ~6 → 20+ (added: OWNS, NAMED, PREFERS, WANTS, KNOWS, IS_BUILDING, SOLVED_WITH, etc.)

### Bug Fixes

- Infinite loop in chunker when `overlapWords >= windowWords` — clamped to `windowWords - 1`
- `start.bat` closed immediately — missing `call` keyword before all `npm`/`npx` invocations
- Session change not broadcast to other tabs — fixed with `broadcastSessionChanged()`
