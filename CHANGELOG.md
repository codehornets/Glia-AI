# SYNQ — Changelog

All notable changes documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-08 — SQLite Native (Zero-Docker) Migration

### Storage Architecture
- **Unified Storage Interface** — Introduced `ISessionStore`, `IGraphStore`, and `IVectorStore` interfaces.
- **SQLite Support** — Implemented `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` backends, allowing Synq to run without Docker (MongoDB, Neo4j, ChromaDB).
- **Dynamic Storage Factory** — Added `SYNQ_STORAGE_MODE` (docker/sqlite) to `.env` to toggle between legacy Docker and new local storage.

### Onboarding & Deployment
- **Zero-Docker Fallback** — `install.bat` and `install.sh` now automatically detect if Docker is missing/not running and default to SQLite mode.
- **Resource Efficiency** — SQLite mode reduces RAM requirement to 2GB and disk requirement to 5GB.
- **Version Alignment** — Synchronized version `1.4.2` across all modules: backend, dashboard, extension manifest, and MCP server.

### Maintenance & Fixes
- **Unified ID Validation** — Updated `isValidObjectId` to support both MongoDB ObjectIds and standard UUIDs for SQLite compatibility.
- **Jobs Worker** — Migrated background extraction worker to the unified storage layer.
- **MCP Server** — Full support for SQLite mode added to the Model Context Protocol server.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-05 — Expanding Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

- **New: DeepSeek (chat.deepseek.com)** — Full support. Leverages DeepSeek's stable `#chat-input` ID and product-specific `.ds-markdown` classes.
- All platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) now share the same multi-strategy resolver architecture.

### Automated Maintenance

- **Expanded Selector Monitoring** — `scripts/check-selectors.js` and the weekly GitHub Action now monitor all 4 platforms.
- **Fail-fast CI** — Selector staleness check updated to alert on DeepSeek regressions.

### Version Alignment

- Unified project versioning across extension manifest, extension package, backend, and dashboard to `1.4.2`.


## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-03 — Security, MCP & Production Hardening

### Security

- **Prompt injection defence** — `backend/src/middleware/sanitize.ts` scans every retrieved RAG chunk for 10 known injection patterns before it reaches any AI. Matching content is replaced with `[Content redacted: potential prompt injection pattern detected]`
- **XML context delimiters** — all injected context is wrapped in `<synq_retrieved_context>` XML tags. LLMs treat XML-tagged content as structured data rather than executable instructions
- **SECURITY.md** — expanded with prompt injection threat model and Groq privacy disclosure

### MCP Server — Universal Memory Layer

- New: `backend/src/mcp/server.ts` — standalone stdio MCP server compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop
- Five tools: `recall_context`, `store_memory`, `search_memory`, `list_projects`, `get_project_summary`
- All tools use the same MongoDB, ChromaDB, and Neo4j databases as the Chrome extension
- New: `MCP_SETUP.md` — copy-paste setup guide for all supported AI tools

### Resilient Selectors

- New: `extension/src/platform/resolver.ts` — multi-strategy DOM selector resolver
- Each platform now has 4–7 ordered fallback strategies: testid → aria-label → role → placeholder → generic contenteditable
- `MutationObserver` in `watchForInput()` auto-reconnects when the input is not yet in the DOM (SPA navigation)
- Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini platform files updated to use `INPUT_SELECTOR_STRATEGIES` from the resolver

### Smart Ollama / Groq Auto-Detect

- `extractor.ts` — probes Ollama at startup. Uses `llama3.1:8b` locally if available; falls back to Groq with an explicit privacy warning if not
- `GROQ_API_KEY` removed from mandatory env validation — now strictly optional
- New env vars: `GRAPH_BACKEND` (force `ollama` or `groq`), `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default: `llama3.1:8b`)

### Production Dashboard

- `backend/src/index.ts` — `sirv` middleware serves `dashboard/dist/` as static files on port 3001
- No separate Vite dev server needed. Dashboard URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- Dashboard build reduced from ~5 MB to ~319 KB (gzip: 105 KB)
- CORS allowlist updated to include `localhost:3001`

### Lite Mode

- `docker-compose.yml` — added `full` and `lite` profiles. Neo4j tagged as `full` only
- New: `docker-compose.lite.yml` — standalone file with only MongoDB + ChromaDB

### Installers & Launchers

- New: `install.sh` — one-command first-time setup for macOS/Linux (~3 min)
- New: `install.bat` — one-command first-time setup for Windows
- Updated: `start.bat` — RAM detection (WMIC), `llama3.1:8b` model check, dashboard build step, plain ASCII output (no box-drawing characters)
- Updated: `start.sh` — RAM detection, Docker profiles, builds production dashboard instead of starting Vite dev server, adds MCP reference

### CI/CD & Maintenance

- New: `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` — full RAG pipeline integration test on every PR
- New: `.github/workflows/selector-check.yml` — weekly headless check for selector staleness; auto-creates GitHub issues
- New: `.github/workflows/release.yml` — auto-creates GitHub Release with extension zip on version tags
- New: `backend/tests/pipeline.integration.test.ts` — seeds a fixture and asserts end-to-end retrieval
- New: `ROADMAP.md` — versioned milestones and planned features

### TypeScript

- `backend/tsconfig.json` — `include: ["src/**/*"]` explicit, `tests/` excluded from rootDir, `resolveJsonModule: true` added. Compilation: 0 errors.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-03 — Startup Robustness

- Forced Docker Compose project name to `synq` — prevents errors when the repository folder has dots or version numbers in the name
- Removed Unicode box-drawing characters from `start.bat` that caused rendering errors in Windows CMD

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-03 — UI Refinement & Extension Features

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-01 — Scripts & Documentation

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-27 — UI/UX Overhaul & Open Source Readiness

### Dashboard — Graph

- Degree-scaled nodes: 8–60px radius — hub nodes visually dominant
- Curved quadratic bezier edges with hover-reveal labels
- Per-type colored glow filters (22 types)
- Hover tooltip: name, type, connection count
- Zoom controls (+/−/reset)
- 3D radial gradient fills

### Dashboard — Chat Viewer

- Turn parser from raw text into styled bubbles
- Header stats: turn count, message count, save date

### Dashboard — App Shell

- Sidebar redesign with Outfit typeface
- Skeleton loaders during data loading
- Error banner when backend is unreachable
- React hook lint errors resolved (0 ESLint errors)

### Open Source

- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-26 — Zero-Loss RAG + Auto-Connect

### RAG Pipeline

Replaced the Groq topic splitter with a pure sliding window chunker:

| | Groq Topic Splitter | Sliding Window Chunker |
|---|---|---|
| Personal facts | Deleted as "filler" | Preserved verbatim |
| Short messages | Rejected | Always included |
| API call on save | Yes | None |
| Data loss | Significant | Zero |

### Auto-Connect

Replaced manual Connect button with automatic interceptor attachment on init(). Simple Pause/Resume toggle replaces the connect state machine.

### Knowledge Graph

- Entity types: 12 → 22 (added: Person, Pet, Goal, Problem, Preference, Habit, Tool, Pattern, Location, Organization)
- Relation types: ~6 → 20+ (added: OWNS, NAMED, PREFERS, WANTS, KNOWS, IS_BUILDING, SOLVED_WITH, etc.)

### Bug Fixes

- Infinite loop in chunker when `overlapWords >= windowWords` — clamped to `windowWords - 1`
- `start.bat` closed immediately — missing `call` keyword before all `npm`/`npx` invocations
- Session change not broadcast to other tabs — fixed with `broadcastSessionChanged()`
